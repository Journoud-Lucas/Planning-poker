Planning Poker is a fun way to estimate the development effort of features. Its simple and sleek interface allows teams to easily estimate the time required for desired tasks.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{üéì School Project}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
This is a small project made for \href{https://www.univ-lyon2.fr/}{\texttt{ Universit√© Lumi√®re Lyon 2}}. Named under the code name project CAPI, we were tasked with creating a project planning application in the desired programming language while implementing agile design practices.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{üîß Features}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Intuitive User Interface\+:}} A simple and ergonomic interface to facilitate session management.
\item {\bfseries{Card Selection\+:}} Choose from a selection of different cards for voting. A coffee card is also included, allowing the session to be paused.
\item {\bfseries{Session Modes\+:}} Two game modes are currently available. \char`\"{}\+Strict,\char`\"{} where players must all agree on task estimates, and \char`\"{}\+Average,\char`\"{} which starts in strict mode and then averages the players\textquotesingle{} votes.
\item {\bfseries{JSON\+:}} JSON format is used for data storage. This format\textquotesingle{}s advantage is its potential compatibility with other applications in the future.
\item {\bfseries{JSON Viewer\+:}} An integrated JSON viewer allows you to easily view the results of your Planning Poker sessions.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{üöÄ Usage}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries{Create a JSON File\+:}} Create a JSON file by naming it and specifying its tasks.
\item {\bfseries{Select a JSON File\+:}} Choose a JSON file. If it\textquotesingle{}s a JSON that\textquotesingle{}s already been completed (the planning poker session has already been run and is finished), we won\textquotesingle{}t be able to launch a session.
\item {\bfseries{Start Sessions\+:}} Launch a session and enter the participants.
\item {\bfseries{Task Estimation\+:}} Players estimate tasks one by one. They can use the coffee card at any time to pause the program.
\item {\bfseries{End the Session\+:}} When consensus is reached, the average (or other depending on the chosen mode) is recorded in the JSON. Once all tasks are estimated, the JSON is finalized.
