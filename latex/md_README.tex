Planning Poker is a fun way to estimate the development effort of features. Its simple and sleek interface allows teams to easily estimate the time required for desired tasks.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{üéì School Project}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
This is a small project made for \href{https://www.univ-lyon2.fr/}{\texttt{ Universit√© Lumi√®re Lyon 2}}. Named under the code name project CAPI, we were tasked with creating a project planning application in the desired programming language while implementing agile design practices.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{üîß Features}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Intuitive User Interface\+:}} A simple and ergonomic interface to facilitate session management.
\item {\bfseries{Card Selection\+:}} Choose from a selection of different cards for voting. A coffee card is also included, allowing the session to be paused.
\item {\bfseries{Session Modes\+:}} Two game modes are currently available. \char`\"{}\+Strict,\char`\"{} where players must all agree on task estimates, and \char`\"{}\+Average,\char`\"{} which starts in strict mode and then averages the players\textquotesingle{} votes.
\item {\bfseries{JSON\+:}} JSON format is used for data storage. This format\textquotesingle{}s advantage is its potential compatibility with other applications in the future.
\item {\bfseries{JSON Viewer\+:}} An integrated JSON viewer allows you to easily view the results of your Planning Poker sessions.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{üöÄ Usage}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries{Create a JSON File\+:}} Create a JSON file by naming it and specifying its tasks.
\item {\bfseries{Select a JSON File\+:}} Choose a JSON file. If it\textquotesingle{}s a JSON that\textquotesingle{}s already been completed (the planning poker session has already been run and is finished), we won\textquotesingle{}t be able to launch a session.
\item {\bfseries{Start Sessions\+:}} Launch a session and enter the participants.
\item {\bfseries{Task Estimation\+:}} Players estimate tasks one by one. They can use the coffee card at any time to pause the program.
\item {\bfseries{End the Session\+:}} When consensus is reached, the average (or other depending on the chosen mode) is recorded in the JSON. Once all tasks are estimated, the JSON is finalized.

To compile and run the Planning Poker application on your computer, you will need certain tools and libraries. Here\textquotesingle{}s a guide to help you set up your development environment\+:\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsubsection{Prerequisites}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries{Required Operating System\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Windows
\item The program should work on Mac and Linux, but it has not been tested on these platforms.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Qt Framework\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The application uses the Qt framework for the user interface. You need to install Qt version 6.\+7.\+3. You can download it from \href{https://www.qt.io/download}{\texttt{ qt.\+io}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{C++ Compiler\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make sure you have a compiler compatible with C++17. I used MSVC 2022 v6.\+7.\+3 64-\/bit, selected during the Qt installation.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Qt Modules\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Only the core modules {\ttfamily Qt Core}, {\ttfamily Qt GUI}, and {\ttfamily Qt Widgets}, which are part of the base Qt installation, were used.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Visual Studio\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To use Qt with Visual Studio, you need to install the {\bfseries{Qt Visual Studio Tools}} extension. Then, in the extension settings, go to {\ttfamily Versions} and add the path to your Qt version. Example\+: {\ttfamily C\+:\textbackslash{}Qt\textbackslash{}6.\+7.\+3\textbackslash{}msvc2022\+\_\+64}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsubsection{Compilation Instructions}\label{md_README_autotoc_md6}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries{Compile the Project\+:}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item On {\bfseries{Windows}} with Visual Studio\+: Open the {\ttfamily .sln} file generated in Visual Studio and build the solution.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Run the Application\+:}} Once the compilation is successful, you can run the application.
