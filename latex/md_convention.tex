\item The next words begin with a capital letter

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Prefix
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Some variable types must have a prefix. If your variable follows more than one of these instructions, do them all in order.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Member variables must begin with the prefix m\+\_\+
\item QString\+List -\/$>$ s\+List
\item string, QStrings (and other derivatives) -\/$>$ s
\item int -\/$>$ n
\item double -\/$>$ d
\item bool -\/$>$ b
\item Pointer -\/$>$ p
\item Object name (without the q for qt objects)
\item Vector -\/$>$ vec
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Some variable types must have a suffix. If your variable follows more than one of these instructions, do them all in order.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item function parameters -\/$>$ in
\item value returned by a function -\/$>$ out
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The first letter of the first word of a function is capitalized.
\item There must be a space before and after these characters\+: \textquotesingle{}\&\&\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}$\vert$$\vert$\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}==\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}!=\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}$<$=\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}=$>$\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}$<$$<$\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}$>$$>$\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}?\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}\+:\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}+\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}=\textquotesingle{}.
\item There must be a space after these characters\+: \textquotesingle{},\textquotesingle{}.
\item Acolades must be on a single line.
\item Functions must not exceed 60 lines in length.
\item For header files, their extensions must be .h and not .hpp.
\item First the Qt includes and others between \textquotesingle{}$<$\textquotesingle{} \textquotesingle{}$>$\textquotesingle{} then a skip line and the project includes between \textquotesingle{}\char`\"{}\textquotesingle{} \textquotesingle{}\char`\"{}\textquotesingle{}.
\item Includes in alphabetical order.
\item Inclusions must be made in the .cpp file. Inclusions in the .h file should only be those necessary.
