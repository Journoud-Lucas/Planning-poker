Planning Poker is a fun way to estimate the development effort of features. Its simple and sleek interface allows teams to easily estimate the time required for desired tasks.

## üéì School Project

This is a small project made for [Universit√© Lumi√®re Lyon 2](https://www.univ-lyon2.fr/).
Named under the code name project CAPI, we were tasked with creating a project planning application in the desired programming language while implementing agile design practices.

## üîß Features

- **Intuitive User Interface:** A simple and ergonomic interface to facilitate session management.
- **Card Selection:** Choose from a selection of different cards for voting. A coffee card is also included, allowing the session to be paused.
- **Session Modes:** Two game modes are currently available. "Strict," where players must all agree on task estimates, and "Average," which starts in strict mode and then averages the players' votes.
- **JSON:** JSON format is used for data storage. This format's advantage is its potential compatibility with other applications in the future.
- **JSON Viewer:** An integrated JSON viewer allows you to easily view the results of your Planning Poker sessions.

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Create a JSON File:** Create a JSON file by naming it and specifying its tasks.
2. **Select a JSON File:** Choose a JSON file. If it's a JSON that's already been completed (the planning poker session has already been run and is finished), we won't be able to launch a session.
3. **Start Sessions:** Launch a session and enter the participants.
4. **Task Estimation:** Players estimate tasks one by one. They can use the coffee card at any time to pause the program.
5. **End the Session:** When consensus is reached, the average (or other depending on the chosen mode) is recorded in the JSON. Once all tasks are estimated, the JSON is finalized.

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation Environment Setup

To compile and run the Planning Poker application on your computer, you will need certain tools and libraries. Here's a guide to help you set up your development environment:

### Prerequisites

1. **Required Operating System:**
   - Windows
   - The program should work on Mac and Linux, but it has not been tested on these platforms.

2. **Qt Framework:**
   - The application uses the Qt framework for the user interface. You need to install Qt version 6.7.3. You can download it from [qt.io](https://www.qt.io/download).

3. **C++ Compiler:**
   - Make sure you have a compiler compatible with C++17.
     I used MSVC 2022 v6.7.3 64-bit, selected during the Qt installation.

4. **Qt Modules:**
   - Only the core modules `Qt Core`, `Qt GUI`, and `Qt Widgets`, which are part of the base Qt installation, were used.

5. **Visual Studio:**
   - To use Qt with Visual Studio, you need to install the **Qt Visual Studio Tools** extension. Then, in the extension settings, go to `Versions` and add the path to your Qt version. Example: `C:\Qt\6.7.3\msvc2022_64`

### Compilation Instructions
1. **Compile the Project:**
   - On **Windows** with Visual Studio:
     Open the `.sln` file generated in Visual Studio and build the solution.

2. **Run the Application:**
   Once the compilation is successful, you can run the application.
